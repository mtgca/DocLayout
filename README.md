# Implementation of "Deep Learning in Time-Frequency Domain for Document Layout Analysis"

This repository contains the implementation of the paper ["Deep Learning in Time-Frequency Domain for Document Layout Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125913), which explores advanced methods for document layout analysis using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

To support the research presented in the paper, we constructed the dataset ["SCIBANK: A LARGE DATASET OF ANNOTATED SCIENTIFIC PAPER REGIONS FOR DOCUMENT LAYOUT ANALYSIS"](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/2yex-bt23). SCIBANK is a comprehensive dataset containing annotated regions of scientific papers, designed to facilitate document layout analysis tasks.


To use the dataset mentioned in the paper, please download the "Database" folder from the following Google Drive link:
